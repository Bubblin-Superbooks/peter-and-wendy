<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A merry hour, a hempen rope,</p><p>And hey for Davy Jones.'</p><p>At once the lost boysâ€”but where are they? They are no longer there. Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.</p><p>I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has darted away to reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. But how have they reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a pile of brushwood, which if removed would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each having in its hollow trunk a hole as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons. Will he find it to-night?</p></div> </div>
